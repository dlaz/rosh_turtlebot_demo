rosh_turtlebot_demo
===================

rosh demo for ROSCON 2014. The demo contains launch files and code to run two simulated turtlebots, and have them play tag. One turtlebot moves around randomly, and the other one tries to bump into it. When a bump occurs, both robots are teleported to random locations and the game resumes.
